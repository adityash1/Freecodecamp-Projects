					C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety
					of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical
					approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.
				</p>
				<p>
					C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key
					advantages of learning C++:
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>
							C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory
							management, better performance and finally a robust software development.
						</li>
						<li>
							C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation
							of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
						</li>
						<li>
							C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++
							programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.
						</li>
						<li>
							C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest
							of software development.
						</li>
						<li>
							C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable
							types their scopes etc.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<p>Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve
					a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.
					The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Terminal - The rounded rectangles, or terminal points, indicate the flowchart’s starting and ending points.</li>
					<li>Flow Lines - Note: The default flow is left to right and top to bottom (the same way you read English). To save
						time arrowheads are often only drawn when the flow lines go contrary the normal.</li>
					<li>Decision - The diamond is used to represent the true/false statement being tested in a decision symbol.
					</li>
					<li>Process - The rectangle depicts a process such as a mathematical computation, or a variable assignment.</li>
					<li>Input/Output - The parallelograms designate input or output operations.
					</li>
				</ul>

		<section id="Conditionals" class="main-section">
			<header>Conditionals</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>Less than: a < b</li>
								<li>Less than or equal to: a <=b </li>
										<li>Greater than: a > b</li>
										<li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
										<li>Equal to a == b</li>
										<li>Not Equal to: a != b</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>
				<p>
					C++ has the following conditional statements:
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
						<li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
						<li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
						<li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The if Statement: Use the if statement to specify a block of C++ code to be executed if a condition is true.
					<code>
                if (condition) {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              }
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.            
            <code>
                if (condition) {
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                  } else {
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
                  }
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The else if Statement: Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
            <code>
                if (condition1) {
                    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
                  } else if (condition2) {
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
                  } else {
                    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
                  }

        <p>
            Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while - is an operator used for subtraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Arithmetic Operators 
                    <code>
                        a + b;
                        a - b;
                        a * b;
                        a / b;
                        a % b;
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assignment Operators 
                    <code>
                        // assign 5 to a
                        a = 5;
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Relational Operators
                    <code>
                        // checks if a is greater than b
                        a > b;

                        //Output
                        3 == 5 is 0
                        3 != 5 is 1
                        3 > 5 is 0
                        3 < 5 is 1
                        3 >= 5 is 0
                        3 <= 5 is 1
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Logical Operators
                    <code>
                        Suppose,
                        a = 5
                        b = 8

                        Then,

                        (a > 3) && (b > 5) evaluates to true
                        (a > 3)  && (b < 5) evaluates to false

                        (a > 3) || (b > 5) evaluates to true
                        (a > 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to true
                        (a < 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to false

                        !(a < 3) evaluates to true
                        !(a > 3) evaluates to false
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bitwise Operators
                    <code>
                        &   Binary AND
                        |   Binary OR

        <p>
            A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.
            The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
        </p>
        <p>Example :</p>
        <code>
                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                
                int max(int x, int y)
                {
                    if (x > y)
                    return x;
                    else
                    return y;
                }
                
                int main() {
                    int a = 10, b = 20;
                
                    // Calling above function to find max of 'a' and 'b'
                    int m = max(a, b);
                
                    cout << "m is " << m;
                    return 0;

          <article>
          <p>An array in C/C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array.  They can be used to store collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type. To add to it, an array in C/C++ can store derived data types such as the structures, pointers etc. Given below is the picture representation of an array.</p>
          <p>
            Advantages of an Array in C/C++: 
            <ol>
                <li>access of elements using array index.</li>
                <li>Use of less line of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.</li>
                <li>Easy access to all the elements.</li>
                <li>Traversal through the array becomes easy using a single loop.</li>
                <li>Sorting becomes easy as it can be accomplished by writing less line of code.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Disadvantages of an Array in C/C++: 
            <ol>
                <li>Allows a fixed number of elements to be entered which is decided at the time of declaration. Unlike a linked list, an array in C is not dynamic.</li>
                <li>Insertion and deletion of elements can be costly since the elements are needed to be managed in accordance with the new memory allocation.</li>
            </ol>
